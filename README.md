have a username and password for logging in NOTE Done but unsure if properly coded. No bcrypt applied
have a display name NOTE Done I think? Should just be username

be associated with a user who wrote them NOTE requires a way to connect
have up to 140 characters of text NOTE Done. Added a max length to the form

Likes should:
be associated with a user who made the like and a message that was liked NOTE requires a connection
The application should have ways to do the following:

Sign up as a new user NOTE Done
Log in NOTE Done
Log out NOTE Not done
View all messages with the newest first NOTE Done. Code needs checked and a way to sort
Create a new message NOTE Form done. Code needs checked? Worked on?
Delete one of your own messages NOTE Needs follow up
Like a message NOTE Likely needs connections and ability to view others?
See who liked a message NOTE Form is done
-->
